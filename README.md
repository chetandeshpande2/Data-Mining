This project explores data mining techniquesâ€”PCA for dimensionality reduction and clustering for pattern discovery. Key steps:

PCA: Scaled data, analyzed eigenvalues (6 PCs retained), and reduced dimensions for clearer insights (e.g., 87% variance explained).

Clustering: Applied hierarchical (3 clusters via dendrogram) and K-means (elbow method, silhouette score: 0.53) to group regions by health/economic metrics. Actionable recommendations were derived for each cluster (e.g., welfare for low-income areas).
